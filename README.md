# Discord.js Bot Starter Code

## Clone this repository to begin development

## Instructions
1. Go to the Discord Developer Website and Create an Application.
2. Create a bot under your application and copy the key it gives you. 

##### **WARNING: DO NOT LOSE OR GIVE OUT THIS KEY! IF THIS DOES HAPPEN, REGENERATE A NEW KEY IN YOUR DISCORD DEVELOPER CONSOLE!**

3. In the ```.env``` file replace ```DISCORD_KEY_GOES_HERE``` with your Discord bot token.
4. Make the bot join your server by creating a bot link [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html).
5. Test out the bot with ```dbs!hello```
6. Change your desired prefix at line 5 (```const prefix = 'dbs!'```) in bot.js to whatever you want. "!" is very overused however so I would discourage from using that prefix.
7. Create your different commands. You can just make a new file with the skeleton of the ```hello.js``` file.
